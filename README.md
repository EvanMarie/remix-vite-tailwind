# Remix with Flat Routes & Tailwind CSS

This project is built using [Remix](https://remix.run/), leveraging Flat Routes for a simplified routing structure, and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. This project was built with Node.js version `[specify version]`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository URL]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd [project-name]
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Remix development server and make your project available at `http://localhost:3000/`. The server will reload if you make edits.

## Using Flat Routes

Remix's Flat Routes structure allows for a simpler and more intuitive routing setup. In this project, routes are defined in the `app/routes` directory. Each route corresponds to a React component, with the file structure mirroring the URL structure.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured and ready to use in this project. You can start adding utility classes to your components right away to style them. For custom configurations, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Building for Production

To build your project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles your Remix application and prepares it for deployment.

## Deployment

For deployment instructions specific to Remix, refer to the [Remix Deployment Documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/deployment).
